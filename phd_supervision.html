      <h2>Doctoral Domain</h2>
      <p>
        I conduct the doctoral supervision activity within the field of
        <strong>Systems Engineering</strong>,
        at the Doctoral School of the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca (UTCN).
        Research topics align with the industry trends and the faculty’s strategic directions in
        automation, robotics, and intelligent systems.

      <h2>Supervision Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        Doctoral supervision is centered on developing the candidate’s capacity
        for independent research, critical thinking, and technical depth.
        Collaboration within international networks and joint research projects
        is strongly encouraged to enhance both scientific visibility and practical relevance.

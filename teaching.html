      <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        The teaching process emphasizes the integration of theoretical foundations with practical experimentation,
        encouraging analytical thinking, creativity, and technical precision.
        The goal is to provide students with the ability to design and implement real-world systems,
        preparing them for both research and industry careers.
